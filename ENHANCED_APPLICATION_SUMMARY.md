const helpResult = {
  title: '🤖 AI Search Assistant - No Documents Indexed',
  content: `Here's how to get started:
  1. Go to Google Drive tab → Select files → Click "Analyze with AI"
  2. Or upload documents first, then search here`,
  // ... detailed guidance
};
```

### 2. Advanced File Processing
```typescript
// Enhanced file extraction with metadata
const fileContents = await this.extractEnhancedFileContents(selectedFileIds);
// Vector embeddings for semantic search
const embeddings = await this.createVectorEmbeddings(fileContents, query);
// Multi-algorithm similarity search
const results = await vectorSearchService.search(query, { algorithm: 'hybrid' });
```

### 3. Multi-LLM Integration
```typescript
// Ensemble approach with multiple AI models
const response = await llmService.generateEnsembleResponse({
  documents: relevantDocs,
  query: userQuery,
  searchType: 'technical'
});
```

### 4. Enhanced 3D Background
```typescript
// Interactive particle system with physics
const particles = [
  { type: 'node', color: 'hsl(200, 80%, 70%)' },
  { type: 'data', color: 'hsl(280, 70%, 60%)' },
  { type: 'energy', color: 'hsl(60, 90%, 70%)' }
];
// Mouse interaction and wave effects
```
