## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS & FIXES**

### **Problem 1: File Content Extraction**
- **Issue**: Files from Google Drive weren't being properly extracted
- **Fix**: ✅ Enhanced file extraction with comprehensive error handling
- **Result**: Files are now properly extracted (confirmed: 2.8MB PDF extracted successfully)

### **Problem 2: Backend Integration**
- **Issue**: Wrong API endpoints and missing file ingestion
- **Fix**: ✅ Corrected to use `/ingest` and `/ask` endpoints
- **Result**: Backend successfully ingests files and performs AI search

### **Problem 3: Analysis Flow**
- **Issue**: Files weren't being indexed before search
- **Fix**: ✅ Added proper ingestion → indexing → search flow
- **Result**: AI analysis now works with selected Google Drive files

### **Problem 4: User Feedback**
- **Issue**: No clear indication of what was happening
- **Fix**: ✅ Added comprehensive progress tracking and detailed results
- **Result**: Users now see clear feedback throughout the process
